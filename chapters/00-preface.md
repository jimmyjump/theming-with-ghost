# Thank you!

Thanks for being interested enough in *Theming with Ghost* to buy it!

I'm excited to document the process of building themes for Ghost, and your support helps make that possible.

If you could share [themingwithghost.com](http://themingwithghost.com) with others interested in building Ghost themes, that would be wonderful.

## A book in progress
This book is highly inspired by the [lean publishing model](https://leanpub.com/manifesto). I'm releasing the book early to get feedback from you, dear readers, so that together we can make the best book about Ghost theming possible.

I'll be releasing updates regularly up until the book is feature complete at v1.0.0. Help me determine what it will mean for a book to be feature complete by emailing me at hi@learnjs.io to let me know what parts of Ghost theming you need to learn about most.

## This book is open source
